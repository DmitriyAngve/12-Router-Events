# 12-adv-starting-project

In this educational project, I studied how an generally congigure routes and make sure that different components are loaded for different paths.
Learned how I can handle errors and how I can set up layouts that wrap itself around multiple routes.
I learned about nested routes and data fetchung and submission. I learn how can generally set up data fetching and submission with loaders and actions.
And learned about advanced use cases - useFetcher to fetch or load data behind the scenes without navigating.
In addition I learned about deferring data fetching (which can be helpful if I can have some slow requests, and i wanna show a page without waiting for the data).
